# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
With this assignment we were to make a coding quiz with html, css and javascript files
We were to have a start button with a countdown timer and with each incorrect answer to the question the timer is to shorten significantly.
The user has an alotted amount of time to successfully complete the quiz and ultimately get a high score at the end of the game.

I tried to get the concept of the basic knowledge creating a barebones version first with just the prompts without the timer and all the buttons in place. Somewhat getting my ground I started designing the html and css file keeping it basic. Of course navigating through javascript was the hardest part and I was still running into issues. I wasn't able to get all my questions to show and had trouble setting up the timer. I'm still getting my footing. I feel like I have somewhat of a better understanding but hoped for a better execution.
